# Would You Rather...?

## React and Redux Project for Udacity's [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

:link: [View Live Project](https://psittacine-reactnd-would-you-rather.netlify.app/)

#### Project Overview

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

This project will solidify your understanding of **React and Redux** while giving you a chance to express your creativity. You’ll practice improving the predictability of your application’s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) will consist of a `_DATA.js` file, which represents a fake database and contains methods that let you access the data. The [_DATA_README.md](src/utils/_DATA_README.md) file outlines how the data is stored and details the methods you can use to access the database.

### Instructions:

* Go to the project directory in the terminal.
* Run the command `yarn install` to install all project dependencies.
* Run the command `yarn start` to start the server and launch the application in your default web browser.
* Choose a user at the log in prompt to interact with the app as that user.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
